A PLEASANT AFTERNOON, SIR. BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY CHECK THE OUTPUT, I JUST WANNA GIVE YOU AN INSIGHT OF THE EFFORTS I'VE EXERTED AND CHALLENGES I HAD TO OVERCOME TO FINISH IT ON TIME. GIVEN THAT THE FINALS IS STEADFAST, I HAD TO MULTITASK TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THE NEEDED PROJECTS AND PAPERWORKS. THE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS THAT I HAD TO ENDURE, ALL THE DISAPPOINTMENTS AND HOPLESSNESS FOR NOT MAKING THE PROGRAM RUN ARE JUST SOME OF THE FEW DIFFICULTIES I HAD TO FACE. THE FACT THAT GITHUB HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRUGGLE ALONG WITH THE LACK OF EXPERIENCE MADE IT EVEN HARDER. ON TOP OF THAT, YOU YOURSELF SIR HAD WITNESSED HOW OFTEN I HAD TO GET BACK TO YOU JUST TO ASK FOR ASSISTANCE. NEVERTHELESS, I'M POSITIVE THAT I HAD DONE EVERYTHING I COULD TO COMPLY ON YOUR SUBJECT. MAY YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARDWORK I'VE SHOWN, SIR. 

P.S. THE RESPONSIVE IS UNFINISHED DUE TO LACK OF TIME AND KNOWLEDGE. I'VE DONE THE HOME PAGE ALONE AND YOU MAY CHECK THE CODE UNDER REPO-MASTER. 

TO: SIR VON
FROM: JAN HUBERT OCHEA
